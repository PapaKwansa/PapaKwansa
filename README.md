- 👋 Hi, I’m @Henry Arhin
- 👀 I’m interested in 2D and 3D heat diffusion problems as well as modeling elastic deformation to characterize fluid flow. I also have an interest in physics-informed machine learning and using it to process and create effective models from strain signals recorded by strainmeters.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with deal.II, COMSOL, and PFLOTRAN
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on numerical modeling of subsurface fractures to characterize fluid flow.
- 📫 How to reach me harhin@clemson.edu
